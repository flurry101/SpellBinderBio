```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flurry101/biolink-website.git
```

### 2. Open the Website

You can view the website by opening `index.html` in your browser. There's no need for a server if you're just testing locally.

### 3. Modify Content

- **Profile Image**: Replace `public/assets/images/image.gif` with your own profile image (GIF, PNG, JPG, etc.).
- **Social Links**: Update the social links in `index.html` to point to your own profiles (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
- **Resume**: Update `public/docs/resume.pdf` with your own resume, or remove it if you don’t want to include one.

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages or Another Static Hosting Service

To deploy your site to GitHub Pages or a similar static hosting platform:

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to the **GitHub Pages** settings of your repository.
3. Set the **source** to your `main` branch or the `/docs` folder.
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/biolink-website/`.

Alternatively, you can deploy to **Netlify** or **Vercel** by linking your GitHub repository and following their instructions.
